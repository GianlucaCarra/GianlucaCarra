#Hi! ☕🐈🎧

I'm Gianluca Carra, a Full-Stack Developer specializing in C# / .NET and Typescript, with experience in developing scalable, high-performance APIs.

In recent years, I have worked on real projects using ASP.NET Core, NestJS (NodeJS), Next.js (React), PostgreSQL, and modern authentication systems such as JWT and OAuth, with a focus on software architecture, code maintainability, and scalability.

My main focus is on the backend, but I also have experience with TypeScript and JavaScript, working with NestJS, Node.js, and React-based applications, which allows me to collaborate effectively in full-stack contexts as well.

##Main technologies:
###• Backend: C#/.NET, ASP.NET Core, REST API, PostgreSQL, Redis, JWT, OAuth, NestJS
###• Frontend: TypeScript, React, Next.js  
###• Tools: Git, Docker, CI/CD, Swagger, Postman  

I am currently looking for **remote or hybrid** opportunities where I can contribute to the development of robust and scalable backend systems.

Feel free to contact me for collaboration or to exchange technical ideas.
